    <h1>OpenSSL License Change Agreement</h1>
    <p>
    This is the server for collecting agreements to the OpenSSL
    license change.
    We want to move from the
    <a href="https://www.openssl.org/source/license.html">current license</a>
    (which can also be found in the file LICENSE in any download),
    to the
    <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"> Apache License
      Version 2.0</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	If you received an email from us, please visit that link in a
	browser (for safety, cut and paste it).
      </li>
      <li>
	If you did not receive an email, perhaps it got lost. If so, you can
	search the database to see which commits we found that contain
	your email; see below.
	If you might have used an old address that no longer works, you can
	see the <a href="cgi-bin/authors.py">full list of authors</a> or
	search on name or email, below.
      </li>
      <li>
	If you did not receive an email, and think you should have done so,
	please email
	<a
	   href="mailto:license@openssl.org">license@openssl.org</a>
	and be as specific as possible.  Please allow some time for us to get back
	to you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are grateful to all the contributors who have contributed to
    OpenSSL and look forward to their help and support in this effort.
    </p>
