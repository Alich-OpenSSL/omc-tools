Hello!

This mail is coming from the OpenSSL development team.

We are working to change the license for OpenSSL. We want to move from
the current license (which is custom-written and has some uncommon
requirements on end-users), to the widely-accepted and common 
Apache License (version 2).  You can find some explanation in
our blog entry:

    https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/08/01/cla/

We wrote some tools to look through every version of our files, and
our scripts found your email address.  You can see what we found:

    https://license.openssl.org/cgi-bin/lookup.py?uid=%(uid)s

We are asking for your permission to change the licence for your
contribution. Please visit this link to respond; you will have a chance
to accept or decline, and enter a brief comment (you can use the comment
to give the names of other people we should contact, for example):

    https://license.openssl.org/cgi-bin/reply.py?uid=%(uid)s&p=%(secret)s

If you have any questions or concerns, please mail to license@openssl.org;
please be patient for a repsonse. You can also post to the public mailing
list, openssl-dev@openssl.org; details about that list can be found at this
site:

    https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-dev

If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you have no objection.

Thank you!

-The OpenSSL Development Team
