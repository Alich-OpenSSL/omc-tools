Hello!

This mail is coming from the OpenSSL development team.

We are working to change the license for OpenSSL. We want to move from
the current license (which is custom-written and has some uncommon
requirements on end-users), to the widely-accepted and common 
Apache License (version 2).  You can find some explanation in
our blog entries:

    https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/20/license/
    https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2015/08/01/cla/

We wrote some tools to look through every version of our files, and
our scripts found your email address.  You can see what we found:

    https://license.openssl.org/cgi-bin/lookup.py?uid=%(uid)s

We are asking for your permission to change the licence for your
contribution. Please visit this link to respond; you will have a chance
to accept or decline, and enter a brief comment (you can use the comment
to give the names of other people we should contact, for example):

    https://license.openssl.org/cgi-bin/reply.py?uid=%(uid)s&p=%(secret)s

If you have any questions or concerns, send email to license@openssl.org;
please be patient for a response. You can also post to the public mailing
list, openssl-dev@openssl.org; details about that list can be found at this
site:

    https://mta.openssl.org/mailman/listinfo/openssl-dev

If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you have no objection.

We are grateful to all the contributors who have contributed to
OpenSSL and look forward to their help and support in this effort.

Thank you!

-The OpenSSL Development Team
