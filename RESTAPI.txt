    member of, with the date they became or were reinstated in the group

/0/Person/:name/IsMemberOf/:group

    Fetches from what date :name became or was reinstated as member
    of :group

/0/Person/:name/ValueOfTag/:tag

    Fetches the value of :tag associated with :name.  This tag is
    usually application specific.

/0/Person/:name/HasCLA

    Fetches the identity under which :name has a CLA, if any.

/0/Group/:group/Members

    Fetches the list of identities belonging to the group :group.

/0/HasCLA/:id

    Checks if there is a CLA under the precise identity :id.  This
    differs from /0/Person/:name/HasCLA in that it demands the precise
    identity (email address or committer id) that the CLA is registered
    under, while /0/Person/:name/HasCLA checks for any CLA associated
    with any of :name's identities and returns a list of what it finds.
